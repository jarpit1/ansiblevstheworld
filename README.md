The purpose of this repo is to serve as one half of my co-op report that is about the different automation solutions available. This repo will contain code written in each solution that performs the same task(s) to highlight the similarities and differences between each solution. Task TBD.i The other half will be a research report documenting the key parts of Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Saltstack and the main ways in which they differ.
